# FactorAnalysis
Code to perform a simple factor analysis model

This repo includes a Gibbs sampler and Stan code for the model found in
the Bhattacharya & Dunson (Biometrika, 2011) paper
for fixed truncation level.

On the simulated dataset, results from the Gibbs sampler agree with the Stan code results.
